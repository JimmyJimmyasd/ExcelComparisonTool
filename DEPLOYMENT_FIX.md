# Streamlit Community Cloud Deployment Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the scipy import error that was preventing deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Files Modified

### 1. requirements.txt
Added missing dependencies:
- scipy>=1.9.0
- plotly>=5.0.0
- matplotlib>=3.5.0
- seaborn>=0.11.0
- fuzzywuzzy>=0.18.0
- python-levenshtein>=0.20.0

### 2. packages.txt (NEW)
Added system-level dependencies for scientific computing:
- build-essential
- gcc
- gfortran
- libatlas-base-dev
- liblapack-dev
- libopenblas-dev
- python3-dev

### 3. analysis/statistical_analysis.py
- Added graceful scipy import handling
- Added fallback implementations for statistical functions when scipy is unavailable
- Added SCIPY_AVAILABLE flag to conditionally use scipy features

### 4. analysis/visualization.py
- Added graceful plotly import handling
- Created dummy classes for when plotly is unavailable
- Fixed type annotations to work with/without plotly

### 5. analysis/data_quality.py
- Added graceful matplotlib/seaborn import handling
- Added availability flags for conditional feature usage

## Deployment Instructions

1. Ensure all files (requirements.txt, packages.txt) are in your repository root
2. Push changes to your GitHub repository
3. Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud
4. The app will now handle missing dependencies gracefully

## Fallback Behavior

When scientific packages are unavailable:
- Statistical tests use simplified implementations
- Charts are disabled with informative messages
- Core Excel comparison functionality remains fully functional

## Testing

All imports and syntax have been verified to work both with and without the optional scientific packages.
