## Testing Recommendations

### üîç Comparison Testing
1. **Two Files Mode**: Create a copy of the file and modify some values to test comparison accuracy
2. **Same File Mode**: Compare different sheets (e.g., Sales_Data vs Employee_Data) to test cross-dataset analysis
3. **Multi-Sheet Batch**: Select multiple sheets for comprehensive batch comparisons

### üìà Statistical Analysis Testing
1. **Financial_Data** - Best for correlation analysis (Revenue vs Profit vs Market Cap)
2. **Sales_Data** - Great for missing data analysis and distributions  
3. **Survey_Data** - Perfect for large dataset performance testing
4. **Employee_Data** - Excellent for categorical analysis and HR metrics

### üéØ Feature Testing Scenarios
- **Missing Data Analysis**: All sheets have intentionally missing values
- **Correlation Detection**: Financial_Data has strong correlations between revenue, profit, and market cap
